//! Thin re-export crate. All SAML logic lives in [`opensaml`].

//! This crate exists only to reserve the `open-saml` name on crates.io and
//! offer a hyphenated alias. Prefer depending on `opensaml` directly.

//! # Disclaimer — no affiliation

//! This is an independent Rust crate. It is **not** affiliated with, derived
//! from, maintained by, endorsed by, or sponsored by the Java
